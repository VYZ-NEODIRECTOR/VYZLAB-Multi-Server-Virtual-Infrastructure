# DHCP Configuration Details

This document outlines the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) settings implemented within the VYZLAB infrastructure to ensure high availability and automated IP management.

## 🚀 Service Overview

The DHCP role is distributed across the domain environment to eliminate single points of failure.

- **Primary Server:** `VYZLAB-DC-01`
- **Failover Server:** `VYZLAB-DC-02`
- **Configuration:** DHCP Failover Cluster

## 🛠 Scope & Networking Details

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **IP Range (Scope)** | 10.1.1.100 — 10.1.1.200 |
| **Subnet Mask** | 255.255.255.0 |
| **Default Gateway** | 10.1.1.1 (pfSense LAN Interface) |
| **Primary DNS** | 10.1.1.10 (`VYZLAB-DC-01`) |
| **Lease Duration** | 8 Days |

## 🛡️ Resilience Strategy

The DHCP service is configured in a **Load Balance** mode (50/50) between the two Domain Controllers. This ensures that:

- **High Availability:** If `VYZLAB-DC-01` goes offline, `VYZLAB-DC-02` continues to lease and renew IP addresses for clients.
- **Client Continuity:** Workstations on the `LAN 1` segment experience zero downtime during server maintenance or unexpected failure.
- **Conflict Prevention:** The failover partnership ensures that IP addresses are not duplicated across the subnet.
